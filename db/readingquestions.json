I could never be sure of finding an undamaged pair of shoes and an unchewed copy of the astropfysical journal. But finally, the puppy became a well-trained dog. She was the only dog that was ever allowed to come into the Observatory. She lay there quietly for hours while I was busy, quite happy if she could hear my voice from time to time. The other astronomers also became fond of her, but from the beginning she was my dog, and obeyes no one else. Not that she always obeyed me.",
